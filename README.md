# 🧠 SQL Practice Project

This project is designed to help you practice and master SQL concepts using realistic, randomly generated datasets.

## 📂 Project Structure

- `customers.csv` — Customer data with basic details like name, email, and signup date.
- `products.csv` — Product catalog with product names and prices.
- `orders.csv` — Orders made by customers, including quantity and order dates.
- `customers_inserts.sql` — SQL `INSERT` statements to populate the `customers` table.
- `products_inserts.sql` — SQL `INSERT` statements for the `products` table.
- `orders_inserts.sql` — SQL `INSERT` statements for the `orders` table.

## 🧱 Database Schema

### `customers`
| Column        | Type      | Description           |
|---------------|-----------|-----------------------|
| customer_id   | INT       | Primary key           |
| customer_name | VARCHAR   | Full name             |
| email         | VARCHAR   | Email address         |
| signup_date   | DATE      | Date of registration  |

### `products`
| Column       | Type       | Description      |
|--------------|------------|------------------|
| product_id   | INT        | Primary key      |
| product_name | VARCHAR    | Name of product  |
| price        | DECIMAL    | Price of product |

### `orders`
| Column      | Type   | Description                       |
|-------------|--------|-----------------------------------|
| order_id    | INT    | Primary key                       |
| customer_id | INT    | Foreign key → `customers`         |
| product_id  | INT    | Foreign key → `products`          |
| order_date  | DATE   | When the order was made           |
| quantity    | INT    | Number of units ordered           |

## ✅ Concepts Covered

This project supports hands-on practice with:

- `JOIN` (INNER, LEFT)
- `GROUP BY` and aggregation
- Filtering using `WHERE` and date logic
- Subqueries
- CASE statements
- Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
- Window Functions (`ROW_NUMBER`, `RANK`, `LEAD`, `LAG`)
- Set Operators (`UNION`, `INTERSECT`, `EXCEPT`)
- String and pattern matching (`LIKE`, `REGEXP`)
- Views and stored procedures (optional)

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Create the tables using the provided `CREATE TABLE` statements.
2. Load the data:
   - Option 1: Use `LOAD DATA INFILE` to load from the CSVs.
   - Option 2: Use the `INSERT` scripts (`*.sql`) to populate tables manually.
3. Run practice queries (starting with JOINs).
4. Track your progress by writing and testing your own queries.

## 📌 Notes

- All data is synthetically generated using Python and Faker.
- Suitable for learning SQL on MySQL or PostgreSQL.
- Data distribution may vary — check for date ranges when filtering.
